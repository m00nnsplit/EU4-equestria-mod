 pony.EVTNAME2: "Luna's Appeal"
 pony.EVTDESC2: "It seems a few lunatic monks have experienced visions and are spreading the word of a 'revelation' : our religion and way of life since the Celestian Englightenment would be wrong. These heretics assert Luna, Celestia's own sister, has revealed them our State is employing the dvine knowledge it has been given for wrong deeds. The end does not justify the means, and the world (and the pony people in particular) does not deserve such violence and imperialism. They call for a peaceful and joyful life without confrontations with our neighbors. These Selenite ideas are spreading like wildfire through the country."

 pony.EVTNAME7: "A Lunar Republic ?"
 pony.EVTDESC7: "The Selenites are constantly getting more and more powerful. The heads of the movement despise our monarchic governement, and would prefer a democratic republic. The situation we are in is already quite tense, and the refusal of their last attempt at negociating would enrage both them and the selenite masses that follow them."
 pony.EVTOPTA7: "Let us listen to the people, for once."

 pony.EVTDESC13: "Both our vassals, the Unicorn possessions and the Earth pony lands, seem to look up to the Pegasus example and dream of independance. They do not see the terrible power we hold !
